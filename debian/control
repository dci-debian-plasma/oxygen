Description: KDE window manager - debug files
 KWin (pronounced as one syllable "kwin") is the window

 but aid you in your task. It paints the window decoration,
 the bar on top of every window with (configurable) buttons
 like close, maximize and minimize. It also handles placing
 of windows and switching between them.
 .
 This package contains the debugging symbols.
